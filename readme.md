## Line of Code

| | Effective line of code* |
|---|---
| Angular | 62 |
| React | 77 |

**Remark:**

Effective line of code counts the 'template' and 'jsx' representing the VDOM, and the typescript controllers, including import statements, type signatures, and empty lines.

The sass/scss are not counted toward the loc.

The angular module file is not counted because it is auto generated and do not require manual modification.
